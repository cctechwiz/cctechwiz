#### A Bit About Me
First and foremost I am a husband and father. I have an amazing wife and two beautiful girls. Most everything I do is to be able to spend quality time with them, and provide them with a life that they are happy with and can thrive in.

Next I am passionate about what I do. Whether that's my family, my job, my volunteer work, or my hobbies. _When I'm in, I'm all in._ I love learning new things and being creative. Which I think is why I've been draw to software engineering and security from a very young age. Those fields allow me to constantly be learning new and better ways to do things as well as flex my creative muscles on a daily basis.

In my current role as a _Cyber Resiliency Software Engineer_ I get to tackle new and exciting problems frequently. And with each new project comes new opportunities to make an impact on national security in new and challenging ways. The breadth of things I've been exposed to is staggering and exciting.

I'm excited to leverage the plethora of things I've been exposed to in my current role in every stage of my career as I progess, and continue to increase my skills and abilities with each new role.

My ultimate career goal is to start my own software business. Whether that looks like freelance consulting, a SaaS company, indie game development, or teaching kids to code I'm not sure yet. I just know that I want to be my own boss someday, living and working on my own terms as much as possible.

#### Navigating My GitHub
My [profile repositories](https://github.com/cctechwiz) have the projects I'm actively working on, the things I'm proud of, and my dot files.

For everything else, I'm currently using GitHub Organization as folders to keep my repositories organized and out of the way.

* [cctechwiz-archive](https://github.com/cctechwiz-archive) for "historic" projects. Either school projects I am allowed to make public or projects from some other ancient time period that I don't want to throw away.
* [cctechwiz-forks](https://github.com/cctechwiz-forks) for forked projects. Either to contribute to or for personal modification and use.
* [cctechwiz-playground](https://github.com/cctechwiz-playground) which is a cluster of potentially broken, incomplete, and messy stuff I want to play around with. Including; tutorials, exercises, PoCs, etc.
* [cctechwiz-teaching](https://github.com/cctechwiz-teaching) as a place to put material I use when teaching (i.e. code camps, presentations, etc.).

##### Lone Llama Workshop:
* [lone-llama-workshop](https://github.com/lone-llama-workshop) is a "workshop" for myself and my brother (@Maxcritter12). We'll be building games, apps, or whatever else tickles our fancy.
