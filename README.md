#### A Bit About Me
First and foremost I am a husband and father. I have an amazing wife and two beautiful girls. Most everything I do is to be able to spend quality time with them, and provide them with a life that they are happy with and can thrive in.

Next I am passionate about what I do. Whether that's my family, my job, my volunteer work, or my hobbies. _When I'm in, I'm all in._ I love learning new things and being creative. Which I think is why I've been draw to software engineering and security from a very young age. Those fields allow me to constantly be learning new and better ways to do things as well as flex my creative muscles on a daily basis.

In my current role as a _Tech Lead / Senior Software Engineer_ on the Common Engineering Toolkit Team (A sub-team of the Developer Experience team) at Qualtrics I get to tackle new and exciting problems frequently. With each new project comes new opportunities to make an impact on all of Qualtrics engineer's experiences and productivity.

My ultimate career goal is to start my own software business. Whether that looks like freelance consulting, a SaaS company, indie game development, or teaching kids to code I'm not sure yet. I just know that I want to be my own boss someday, living and working on my own terms as much as possible.
