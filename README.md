#### A Bit About Me
First and foremost I am a husband and father. I have an amazing wife and two beautiful girls. Most everything I do is to be able to spend quality time with them, and provide them with a life that they are happy with and can thrive in.

Next I am passionate about what I do. Whether that's my family, my job, my volunteer work, or my hobbies. _When I'm in, I'm all in._ I love learning new things and being creative. Which I think is why I've been draw to software engineering and security from a very young age. Those fields allow me to constantly be learning new and better ways to do things as well as flex my creative muscles on a daily basis.
